# Terms of our Server Software License

[Dexie Cloud Server software](docs/premium-software) includes the binaries, source and documentation needed to launch Dexie Cloud on your own infrastructure.

### Purpose of our software license

* to give you full control over your infrastructure - locations, cloud providers, hardware, etc.
* to not get locked in
* to have the freedom to tailor the software or adjust the source code for your application needs
* to have unlimited number of end users for your application without additional cost
* to serve your application without us bothering about your business model for the application that use Dexie Cloud to store and sync its data.

However, there are still limitations with this license, see below.

### <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> You may not compete with our software
This license does not allow you to copy, sell or in other ways redistribute the source or binaries to other companies. The software can be used to serve your application to the entire world without purchasing anything extra for that, but you may not distribute or sell Dexie Cloud Server software itself. A purchased license of Dexie Cloud Server can be used by the company itself only, to act as a storage platform for company-owned application(s).

*NOTE: This applies to Dexie Cloud Server (private source) and not to Dexie.js (open source, Apache 2.0 licensed)*

If you are looking for a redistribution license, please [contact us](mailto:business@dexie.org).

### <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> You may not compete with our cloud offering
This license does not allow you to setup a Dexie Cloud service to be utilized for applications outside your company. You cannot allow 3rd party developers to be tenants on your Dexie Cloud server without purchasing a license for each external company that host their app on your Dexie Cloud server, or else negotiate another agreement with us for that kind of license.

If you are interested in offering Dexie Cloud as service for external companies (like we do), please [contact us](mailto:business@dexie.org) so we can find a fare deal for that.
