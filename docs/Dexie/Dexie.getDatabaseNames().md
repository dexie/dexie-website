title: 'Dexie.getDatabaseNames()'
---

### Syntax

```javascript
Dexie.getDatabaseNames(function callback(names){})
```

### Return Value

[Promise<String[]>](Promise);

### Parameters

 * callback - Just a shortcut for Dexie.getDatabaseNames().then(callback)

### Description

Returns an array of database names at current host.

### Sample

    Dexie.getDatabaseNames(function (databases) {
        for (var i=0; i<databases.length; ++i) {
            console.log(databases[i]);
        }
    });

### Browser Specific Info

This method is an extension to the native indexedDB API which does not support listing of database names. Chrome and Opera has implemented webkitGetDatabaseNames() but neither IE, Edge, Mozilla or Safari supports it. This method will check if webkitGetDatabaseNames() is present and use it if so. Otherwise it will return a list maintained by Dexie by using the localStorage API. The key in localStorage used for this, is "Dexie.DatabaseNames" pointing out a JSON representation of a string array.

This means that on Opera and Chrome, the method will work no matter if the database was created using Dexie or not, but on IE and Firefox, the method will only see databases created using Dexie.

### Not reliable in workers

Currently we use localStorage for maintaining the list of databasenames in non-chromium browsers. Since localStorage is not available from workers, Dexie.getDatabaseNames() will yield an empty array when called from there. Moreover, databases that are created in a worker will never be registered into the localStorage key.

### Detecting When Databases Are Added Or Deleted

In earlier versions of Dexie, it was possible to listen to changes on added/removed database names by using the following piece of code:

    window.addEventListener('storage', function (event) {
        if (event.key === "Dexie.DatabaseNames") {
            console.log("A database was added or removed");
            console.log("Old list: " + event.oldValue);
            console.log("New list: " + event.newValue);
        }
    });

This code will now only work for non chromium browser since [this commit](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/commit/2b029321f97072b096fa08799d61c0a7e78f99a8) removes the use of localStorage for Opera and Chrome. A future version of Dexie may enable a Dexie event to subscribe to for the same purpose that would work the same as before. If this is of interest for you, please file an issue and we'll try fix it.
