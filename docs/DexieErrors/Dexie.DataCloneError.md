### Inheritance Hierarchy

* [Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)
  * [Dexie.DexieError](/docs/DexieErrors/DexieError)
    * Dexie.DataCloneError

### Description 

An attempt to add or put an item into the database was made, where the object contained a strucure not supported by the
[Structured Cloning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) algorithm, such as a Function or Error object.

#### What does this mean?

It means you tried to store an object that contained properties of unsupported (not cloneable) types. The supported types are defined in the DOM standard structured cloning.

Examples of supported types: string, number, Blob, typed arrays, Map, Set, CryptoKey, arrays, booleans, null etc.
Examples of unsupported types: function, symbol, WebSocket, WeakMap, window, document, etc ...

To fix this, you first need to debug your code and look at the data you are trying to put into IndexedDB. Does it contain the data you intend it to contain? Or do you have an application bug that makes it try to store a function or something else that isn't cloneable?


### Sample using Promise.catch()

```javascript
doSomeDatabaseWork().then(result => {
    // Success
}).catch('DataCloneError', e => {
    // Failed with DataCloneError
    console.error ("DataClone error: " + e.message);
}).catch(Error, e => {
    // Any other error derived from standard Error
    console.error ("Error: " + e.message);
}).catch(e => {
    // Other error such as a string was thrown
    console.error (e);
});
```

### Sample: switch(error.name)

```javascript
db.on('error', function (error) {
    switch (error.name) {
        // errnames.DataClone ==="DataCloneError"
        case Dexie.errnames.DataClone:
            console.error ("DataClone error");
            break;
        default:
            console.error ("error: " + e);
    }
});
```
